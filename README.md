The Kissat SAT Solver
=====================

Kissat is a "keep it simple and clean bare metal SAT solver" written in C.
It is a port of CaDiCaL back to C with improved data structures, better
scheduling of inprocessing and optimized algorithms and implementation.

Coincidentally "kissat" also means "cats" in Finnish.

Run `./configure && make test` to configure, build and test in `build`.
